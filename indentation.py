#for blocks python use indentation instead of curly braces.
#both spaces and tabs are supported ,but try to not mix them in same block (some time it gives bugs).
#the standar identation is to use 4 spaces
#Adding string formatter to the program

x=10
if x==10:
    #4 spaces
    print(f'Value of x = {x}')
